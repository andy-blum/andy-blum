A few weeks back, I ran across [an article](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/every-developer-should-have-a-blog-heres-why-and-how-to-stick-with-it-5fd55a247fbf) rattling off a number of reasons web developers should have a blog, and the two that stuck with me were “to learn something new” and “to kickstart your career”.

They say you never fully understand a topic until you are able to explain it. Blogging is a low barrier to explaining things.

So here I am, writing the first blog post of what I hope will be many, just to put words down on a digital page and get some content that I can theme & develop around.
