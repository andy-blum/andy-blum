A group of Lullabots (and Former 'bot and podcast co-host Mike Herchel) get together to discuss the new Default theme in Drupal 9 and 10 that they helped build. The theme called "Olivero" is as beautiful as it is flexible and accessible. The team talks about the immense amount of work it took for a project of such high visibility in the Drupal community.
