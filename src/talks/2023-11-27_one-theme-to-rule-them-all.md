Drupal added a new StarterKit Theme Generator Tool as an experimental feature in Drupal 9.3, and promoted it to "stable" in 10.0. While the tool hasn't received much attention, it will revolutionize the way agencies and product teams create themes for years to come!

This session will cover:
- What the StarterKit tool does out of the box
- How to make your own StarterKit theme
- How Olivero implements StarterKit
- How this tool can accelerate theme development
- How it can help with theme maintenance

To get the most out of this session, attendees should have basic knowledge of Drupal theme creation and object-oriented PHP.
