Creating beautiful, interactive interfaces in Drupal requires carefully-crafted markup, well-designed javascript, and an expert knowledge of Drupal's behaviors system. When done well, we can deliver designs that delight, but if done poorly or in conjunction with a conflicting library, our house of cards can come tumbling down.

Web Components are a platform-native solution to this problem allowing us to build advanced UIs that are easily repeatable, tightly encapsulated, and virtually immune to conflicts. In this session, we'll look at:

- The basics of the browser APIs that enable web components
- A library to make their development easier
- How to bring them into a Drupal theme
- Proposals for utilizing web components in Drupal core
